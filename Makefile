# Because of dynamically linked libraries, this will statically compile the
# app with all libraries built in. You won't be able to cross-compile if CGO
# is enabled. This is because Go binary is looking for libraries on the
# operating system itâ€™s running in. We compiled our app, but it still is
# dynamically linked to the libraries it needs to run
# (i.e., all the C libraries it binds to). When using a minimal docker image
# the operating system doesn't have these libraries.
